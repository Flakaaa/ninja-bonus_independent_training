# Bonus Independent Training Ninja Patch for Gothic 2 NotR

This is a Gothic 2 Ninja patch that changes the way training works such that only "trained points" for a specific skill/stat count toward the LP cost for further training. Other bonuses such as equipment or permanent bonuses (e.g. permanent stat increase potions) won't count.

The main effect of this patch is that you can use the permanent bonuses whenever you want.

## Installation

1. Requires Gothic 2 with Ninja 2+
2. Download BonusIndependentTraining.vdf from a [release assets](https://github.com/elsky42/ninja-bonus_independent_training/releases)
3. Copy BonusIndependentTraining.vdf to the Data directory of your installation
    - e.g. if you installed Gothic 2 inside the directory _gothic II_ then you need to copy the file to _gothic II/Data/BonusIndependentTraining.vdf_
