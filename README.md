# Bonus Independent Training Mod for Gothic 2 NotR

This is a Gothic 2 mod that changes the way training works such that only "trained points" for a specific skill/stat count toward the LP cost for further training. Other bonuses such as equipment or permanent bonuses (e.g. permanent stat increase potions) won't count.

The main effect of this mod is that you can use the permanent bonuses whenever you want.

## Install

1. Requires Gothic 2 with [Ninja 2+](https://github.com/szapp/Ninja)
2. Download BonusIndependentTraining.vdf from a [release assets](https://github.com/elsky42/ninja-bonus_independent_training/releases)
3. Copy BonusIndependentTraining.vdf to the Data directory of your installation
    - e.g. if you installed Gothic 2 inside the directory _gothic II_ then you need to copy the file to _gothic II/Data/BonusIndependentTraining.vdf_

## Uninstall

Just remove BonusIndependentTraining.vdf from your installation Data directory. Note that existing saves will retain the changes made by the mod even after you uninstall it.

## Warning

This mod overrides the way levelling works and it's of course incompatible with any other mod that changes the same functions.
